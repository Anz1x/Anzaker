# Anzaker
Anzaker, a hacking multi-tool made in Python 3.10 by Anz!

I will keep updating this tool, so I will always be fixing any bugs, add new tools here etc.

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible with your illegal intentions with this so please don't use this on someone explicitly without their permission.

# What does it do?

This hacking multi-tool does a lot of stuff revolved around hacking, OSINT & more!

- Port Scanner
- SSH Bruteforce
- Vulnerability Scanner
- FTP Anonymous Login
- Get Information of an IP Address
- Arp Spoofer
- Password Sniffer

I will keep adding new tools to this multi-tool!

NOTE: 
- Currently the SSH Bruteforce is a big buggy right now so I am trying to fix it however it works fast and sort of well
- Vulnerability Scanner isn't fully finished yet, there is still some pending vulnerable banners I need to add so I am working on that
- The Password Sniffer doesn't sniff passwords from the target so I am gonna make that you can steal credentials from the target since it only sniffs on the machine you run this on
